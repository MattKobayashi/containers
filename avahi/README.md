# Avahi Docker Image

Docker image for the Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon. Built on Alpine Linux to make the image as small as possible. Highly configurable through environment variables to support most usecases which need an Avahi Daemon.

## Usage

Basic usage consists of running the docker container with the appropriate environment variables and volumes to achieve your desired behaviour.

```shell
docker run ghcr.io/mattkobayashi/docker-avahi
```

## Environment variables

Environment variables are made available for all of the options of `avahi-daemon.conf`. The variable names are in the format `<SECTION>_<OPTION>` where `<SECTION>` is the capitalised section name from the configuration file and `<OPTION>` is the capitalised option name with `-` replaced by `_`. The table below outlines the available options:

| Section     | Option                            | Variable                                  |

## Examples

This sections contains several example usages for the. If you use this container for a common scenrio or if any of the examples can be improved, please let me know the configurtion you have used so that I can add it here or submit a PR adding it as an example.

### Reflect mDNS broadcasts between networks

To reflect mDNS broadcasts between two docker networks (`net1` and `net2` in the example given) the reflector should be enabled by setting `REFLECTOR_ENABLE_REFLECTOR=yes`.

```shell
# Create a container named mdns-reflector attached to net1
docker run -d --name=mdns-reflector \
  --network net1 \
  -e REFLECTOR_ENABLE_REFLECTOR=yes \
  ghcr.io/mattkobayashi/docker-avahi
# Attach the container to the net2 network
docker network connect net2 mdns-reflector
```

See [Connecting to a phyiscal network](#connecting_to_a_physical_network) to see how you can connect the container to a physical network - for example if you wanted to reflect mDNS between two WiFi VLANs).

### Connecting to a physical network

It is common to want to use this container with one or more physical networks (e.g. as a reflector between WiFi network), in order to do this a docker network can be created using the [macvlan](https://docs.docker.com/network/macvlan/) driver. The following example creates a macvlan network named `physical` connected to the `eno1` interface with subnet `10.0.0.0/24` and gateway `10.0.0.1`.

```bash
docker network create --driver macvlan --subnet 10.0.0.0/24 --gateway 10.0.0.1 --opt parent=eno1 physical
```

You can also connect to a VLAN on a physical interface by suffixing the parent with `.` and the VLAN ID (e.g. `--opt parent=eno1.123` for VLAN 123 on the `eno1` interface. The sub-interface does not need to exist before running the command to create the network as the driver will automatically create this.

To ensure that an IP conflict does not occur, you should specify an available IP address on your physical network when attaching the network to your container. Assuming that your container is called `avahi` and `10.0.0.1` is an available IP in that network, you can connect this network as follows:

```bash
docker network connect physical avahi --ip 10.0.0.10
```
